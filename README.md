## 🌐 Overview

Rising sea levels pose a significant threat to coastal communities worldwide. This project aims to provide accurate predictions of sea level changes using historical data, which can help in planning and mitigation efforts.

## 🔍 Features

- **Time Series Analysis**: Utilizes ARIMA and SARIMA models for time series forecasting.
- **Regression Models**: Employs Lasso, Ridge, and Gradient Boosting for regression analysis.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Implements Random Forest for robust predictions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models using MAE, RMSE, and R².
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides plots for a clear understanding of actual vs. predicted sea levels.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the Global Sea Level Prediction Model, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-sea-level-prediction-model.git
cd global-sea-level-prediction-model
pip install -r requirements.txt

🔧 Usage
To run the model, simply execute the following command:

bash
python models.py
This will run the script and produce predictions using the specified models, along with performance metrics and visualizations.

## 🤖 Models Used
Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that provide a robust prediction.
ARIMA: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average for time series forecasting.
SARIMA: Seasonal ARIMA that accounts for seasonality in the data.
Lasso & Ridge: Regularization techniques for regression problems.
Gradient Boosting: A powerful ensemble technique that builds sequential trees.
📊 Performance Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R² score. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's accuracy and reliability.

## 📈 Visualization
The script includes functions to visualize the actual vs. predicted sea levels, helping users to quickly grasp the model's performance.
